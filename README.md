Yocto is a compact MPD client that appears as an icon in the system
notification area. Clicking on the icon toggles playback, and hovering over
the icon produces a popup window with track information and control buttons.

If you want to install Yocto, run `make install`. You can also build a
Debian or Ubuntu package with `make deb`.
